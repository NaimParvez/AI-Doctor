## Development Guidelines

### üé® Code Style

We follow PEP 8 for Python code style. Please ensure your code adheres to these guidelines:

```python
# Good example
def process_medical_query(query: str, user_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """
    Process a medical query using the AI model.

    Args:
        query: The user's medical question
        user_context: User information for personalized responses

    Returns:
        AI-generated medical response

    Raises:
        ModelError: If the AI model fails to process the query
    """
    if not query.strip():
        raise ValueError("Query cannot be empty")

    # Implementation here
    return response
```

**Key Points:**

- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write clear docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines ideally)
- Add comments for complex logic

### üß™ Testing

All code contributions should include appropriate tests:

```python
# Example test case
def test_user_registration_with_valid_data(client):
    """Test user registration with valid data."""
    response = client.post('/auth/register', data={
        'username': 'testuser',
        'email': 'test@example.com',
        'password': 'securepass123',
        'date_of_birth': '1990-01-01',
        'gender': 'male'
    })
    assert response.status_code == 302
    assert User.query.filter_by(username='testuser').first() is not None
```

**Testing Requirements:**

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Write integration tests for new endpoints
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test both positive and negative scenarios

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

When making database schema changes:

1. **Create Migration**

   ```bash
   flask db migrate -m "Descriptive migration message"
   ```

2. **Review Migration File**

   - Check the generated migration for accuracy
   - Ensure it's reversible (has both upgrade and downgrade)

3. **Test Migration**
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   flask db downgrade  # Test rollback
   flask db upgrade    # Re-apply
   ```

### üîí Security Considerations

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
